# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Welcome to the Future of Intelligence

This textbook introduces you to **Physical AI** (also known as **Embodied Intelligence**), the evolution of artificial intelligence from abstract computation to physically grounded, sensor-driven, and action-oriented systems embedded inside real-world machines such as humanoid robots.

### What You'll Learn

- How to build intelligent humanoid systems using ROS 2
- Creating digital twins with Gazebo and Unity simulations
- Integrating AI agents with robotic bodies for cognitive capabilities
- Developing embodied intelligence systems that learn through interaction

### Core Philosophy

This textbook follows a "Learning by Building" approach where each concept is immediately followed by hands-on implementation. Every chapter includes code examples, simulation tasks, and project components that contribute to building a complete humanoid robot system.

### Modules Structure

The textbook is organized into two main modules:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Learn how to build the communication and control system for a humanoid robot
2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Learn how to create simulation environments for testing and training

### Technology Stack

- **ROS 2** - Robotic Operating System for communication and coordination
- **Gazebo** - Physics-based simulation engine
- **Unity** - High-level visual simulation
- **Python** - Programming language for robotics and AI
- **OpenAI Agent SDK** - For cognitive capabilities
- **Qdrant** - Vector database for robotic memory

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 20.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
